# nfl_nextgenstats_data
 Weekly data scraped from NFL Next Gen Stats website

Currently this is only for passing data and only has 2018 & 2019.

By default, NFL Next Gen Stats website has a minimum of 15 passing attempts in a given week to show up so if you don't see a quarterback for a certain week, that is likely the reason.
