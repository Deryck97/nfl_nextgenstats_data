Weekly data scraped from NFL Next Gen Stats website

Data runs from 2016-present.

The season totals CSV is only 2017-present since 2016 does not include the abbreviated player names.

By default, NFL Next Gen Stats website has a minimum of 15 passing attempts in a given week to show up so if you don't see a quarterback for a certain week, that is likely the reason.
